Hey! Thanks for checking out Hamster Party! We at WagDog games appreciate it. It's our first real game we're developing, hopefully the first of many.

Hamster Party is a game about a party for hamsters! All the hamsters are supposed to be gathering, but no one has shown up yet! Going through the tubes on the wall, you set out to find them!

Getting to the other side of the tube, the situation clarifies. You see a hamster floating far away, unable to make his way through the pipes. You must rotate pipes in three dimensions to help the hamsters find their way home. They'll happily make their way back to the party, and maybe bring back a surprise or two.

Hamster Party is being developed in Unity 2018 for iOS and Android. Follow along with our progress by following [@WagDogGames](https://twitter.com/WagDogGames) on twitter.
